**Total:** ~1,500+ lines of well-documented code and extensive documentation

## Core Components

### 1. Dialogue Engine (`dialogue.lua`)

**Purpose:** UI-agnostic narrative state machine

**Features:**
- ✅ Story progression through knots (named sections)
- ✅ Variable storage and retrieval
- ✅ Choice handling with branching
- ✅ Conditional content display
- ✅ Divert system (jumps between knots)
- ✅ Visit tracking for repeated content
- ✅ History system for choices and knots visited

**API Highlights:**
```lua
dialogue = Dialogue.new(story_data, start_knot)
content = dialogue:getNext()
dialogue:choose(choice_index)
dialogue:setVariable(name, value)
dialogue:getVariable(name)
dialogue:hasEnded()
```

**Extension Points:**
- Save/Load system
- Function calls from stories
- Tag processing
- Threading (parallel storylines)
- Tunnels (temporary diverts)
- Sequences (cycling content)

### 2. UI System (`dialogue_ui.lua`)

**Purpose:** Modular, component-based rendering system

**Components:**
- **Component Base Class** - Abstract interface for all UI elements
- **TextBox** - Dialogue display with typewriter effect
- **ChoiceList** - Interactive choice buttons
- **DialogueUI Manager** - Coordinates all components

**Features:**
- ✅ Typewriter effect (configurable speed)
- ✅ Speaker name display
- ✅ Word-wrapped text
- ✅ Hover effects on choices
- ✅ Click-to-advance interaction
- ✅ Fully customizable styling and positioning
- ✅ Components can be enabled/disabled per scene

**Customization:**
```lua
ui = DialogueUI.new({
  textbox = {x, y, width, height, colors, fonts, typewriter_speed},
  choicelist = {x, y, width, button_height, colors, fonts}
})
```

**Extensible Components:**
- Portrait (character images)
- Backlog (dialogue history)
- Auto-play toggle
- Save/Load menu
- Settings panel
- Custom components (inherit from Component)

### 3. Story Helpers (`story_helpers.lua`)

**Purpose:** Utility functions for cleaner story authoring

**Functions:**
- `text(content, speaker, tags)` - Create dialogue lines
- `choice(prompt, options)` - Create player decisions
- `divert(target)` - Jump to another knot
- `set(var, value)` - Variable assignment
- `condition(var, value, content, operator)` - Conditional content

**Makes Stories Readable:**
```lua
-- Without helpers (verbose)
{type = "text", content = "Hello", speaker = "Alice"}

-- With helpers (clean)
text("Hello", "Alice")
```

### 4. Example Story (`example_story.lua`)

**Purpose:** Complete working example demonstrating all features

**Demonstrates:**
- ✅ Linear dialogue progression
- ✅ Branching narrative with choices
- ✅ Knot navigation with diverts
- ✅ Variable storage and retrieval
- ✅ Conditional content based on state
- ✅ Multiple endings based on player choices
- ✅ Replay functionality

**Story Structure:**
- 15+ knots
- Multiple branching paths
- 2 different endings
- Variable tracking (learned_symbols, has_key, etc.)
- Demonstrates best practices

### 5. Demo Application (`main.lua`)

**Purpose:** Complete integration example

**Features:**
- ✅ Full framework integration
- ✅ Keyboard and mouse controls
- ✅ Debug information display
- ✅ Restart functionality
- ✅ Instructions for users

**Controls:**
- Click or Space - Advance dialogue
- Click choices - Select option
- D - Debug (show variables)
- R - Restart story
- ESC - Quit

## What Makes This Framework Special

### 1. Lua-Native Design
- No external compilers or tools required
- Write stories directly in Lua
- Full access to Lua's power when needed
- No JSON parsing overhead

### 2. Modular Architecture
- Dialogue engine works independently of UI
- UI components are swappable
- Easy to integrate into existing games
- Use only what you need

### 3. Flexible for Different Game Types

**Visual Novels:**
- Use full UI system
- Add portrait components
- Include character names and emotions

**RPGs:**
- Integrate with existing UI
- Use dialogue engine only
- Process tags for game events

**Adventure Games:**
- Minimal UI
- Custom rendering
- Inventory integration via variables

**Interactive Fiction:**
- Engine-only approach
- Custom text rendering
- Focus on narrative

### 4. Well-Documented
- 1000+ lines of inline documentation
- Three comprehensive markdown guides
- Working examples throughout
- Clear extension points marked

### 5. Production-Ready
- No linter errors
- Proper error handling
- Defensive coding practices
- Performance-conscious design

## Technical Highlights

### Code Quality
- **Consistent Style:** Following Lua best practices
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and helpful error messages
- **Comments:** Extensive inline documentation
- **Extension Points:** Clearly marked for future development

### Design Patterns
- **Component Pattern:** UI system uses component-based architecture
- **State Machine:** Dialogue engine is a clean state machine
- **Callback Pattern:** UI uses callbacks for events
- **Factory Pattern:** Helper functions create structured data

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal table allocations in hot paths
- No string concatenation in loops
- Efficient content iteration
- Optional typewriter effect (can be disabled)
